// NOT SOLVED

// Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
// The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
// If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

// Input: "   -42"
// Output: -42

// Input: "4193 with words"
// Output: 4193


// Input: "words and 987"
// Output: 0

// Input: "-91283472332"
// Output: -2147483648
// Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
// Thefore INT_MIN (âˆ’2^31) is returned.
